# Endpoint curated to match the CEU's definition of incident CVD
# and prevalent vascular disease. Incident disease follow-up is 
# restricted to 10 years, as most risk prediction scores operate
# on a 10-year time horizon.

# Incident disease follow-up options
Max follow years: 10 

# Incident CVD is incident CHD + Stroke:

# Incident CHD
Incident ICD-10: I21, I22            # Myocardial infarction
Fatal incident ICD-10: I20-I25       # Fatal CHD

# Incident stroke
Incident ICD-10: I63                 # Ischaemic stroke
Incident ICD-10: I61                 # Haemorrhagic stroke
Incident ICD-10: I60                 # Subarachnoid haemorrhage
Incident ICD-10: I64                 # Unclassified stroke
Fatal incident ICD-10: I60-I69, F01  # Fatal cerebrovascular events

# Prevalent vascular disease is defined as history of CHD, other 
# heart disease, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, peripheral 
# vascular disease, angina, or cardiovascular surgery. This is 
# used to exclude people from incident disease analyses.

# History of heart disease or angina
